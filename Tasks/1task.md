# Task 1: Code Management System

## Git Source Code Management

Git is a popular source code management system.
Every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository, with complete history and full version tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a central server.
In this sense, it trades off space for speed.
Git is primarily developed on Linux, although it also supports most major operating systems including BSD, OS~X, and Microsoft Windows.
Pertinent information about Git can be found on the project website.
