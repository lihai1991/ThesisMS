\chapter{CONCLUSION}
\ignore{This work will include a numerical simulation corresponding to two estimation schemes. The simulation code is written in python. The simulation will show the performance comparison between directional antenna and isotropic antenna. The performance is evaluated via estimation error(BMSE for Bayesian estimation and MSE for maximum likelihood estimation). Preliminary results shows that performance improved when using directional antennas. To further support this result, an experiment will be conducted in the line of sight areas to obtain the experimental data. The performance of estimation will be reported with the experimental data obtained.}
