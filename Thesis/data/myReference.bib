Energy-unaware behaviour can add one-third to a building's designed energy performance. Consequently, user activity and behaviour is considered as a key element and has long been used for control of various devices such as artificial light, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning. However, how are user activity and behaviour taken into account? What are the most valuable activities or behaviours and what is their impact on energy saving potential? In order to answer these questions, we provide a novel survey of prominent international intelligent buildings research efforts with the theme of energy saving and user activity recognition. We devise new metrics to compare the existing studies. Through the survey, we determine the most valuable activities and behaviours and their impact on energy saving potential for each of the three main subsystems, i.e., HVAC, light, and plug loads. The most promising and appropriate activity recognition technologies and approaches are discussed thus allowing us to conclude with principles and perspectives for energy intelligent buildings based on user activity.

In our proposed method, the number of optical flows whose segment crosses the counting line is used for estimation of the number of pedestrians. To improve accuracy of estimation, we delete optical flows detected falsely or extracted from background image. Through experimental evaluations using actual video sequences, we show that the correlation coefficient between the number of optical flows and the number of pedestrians passing through the counting line is more than 0.856. We also show that the mean relative error of our proposed method is less than 0.068.},

	abstract = {This paper firstly presents the benefits and critical challenges on the use of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi for crowd data collection and monitoring. The major challenges include antenna characteristics, environment{'}s complexity and scanning features. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are compared in this paper in terms of architecture, discovery time, popularity of use and signal strength. Type of antennas used and the environment{'}s complexity such as trees for outdoor and partitions for indoor spaces highly affect the scanning range. The aforementioned challenges are empirically evaluated by {``}real{''} experiments using Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Scanners. The issues related to the antenna characteristics are also highlighted by experimenting with different antenna types. Novel scanning approaches including Overlapped Zones and Single Point Multi-Range detection methods will be then presented and verified by real-world tests. These novel techniques will be applied for location identification of the MAC IDs captured that can extract more information about people movement dynamics. }
